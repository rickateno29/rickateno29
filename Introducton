- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rickateno29, I am a data scientist and also a blogger
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming language since 2016 I worked at an Information System Company in the field of GIS...
- ðŸŒ± But Iâ€™m currently learning for python because I've never understood it ...
- For me python is difficult, but I never wanna give up and I will continoue to learn until I became an expert in this field :D
